# Interactive 3D Book with Three.js

A hyper-realistic 3D book visualization that allows for manual interaction and manipulation. This project serves as a foundation for a larger digital library collection.

## Features

- Realistic 3D book model with dynamic page turning
- Interactive controls for opening/closing the book and turning pages
- Procedurally generated textures for leather, cloth, and hardcover materials
- Physics-based material rendering with normal maps and texturing
- Manual page turning with mouse interaction
- Keyboard shortcuts for book manipulation

## Keyboard Controls

- Arrow Keys: Rotate and tilt the book
- Space: Toggle book open/closed
- Page Up/Down: Turn pages
- Home: Reset book position

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebGL
2. Use the controls panel on the right to manipulate the book
3. Click and drag on the book to rotate it
4. When the book is open, hover over a page and drag horizontally to turn it

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- HTML5 Canvas for procedural texture generation
- CSS3 for UI styling

## Next Steps for Library Collection

- Add multiple book models with different sizes and styles
- Implement bookshelf visualization
- Add book metadata and preview functionality
- Create library navigation and search features
